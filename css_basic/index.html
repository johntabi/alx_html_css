            <h2>Service Above Self</h2>
            <p>
                African youths have taken it upon themselves to uplift the standards of their communities, especially in
                areas of community development, social welfare and entreprenuership. These Youths are changing lives
                through activities aimed at identifying brilliant young Africans to take up roles in community
                leadership, to lead the dialogue on development, get involved in civil society organizations or their
                professional activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                These youths have organised themselves in different associations and organizations depending on their
                approach to better help their communities.
            </p>
            <h2>Not For Profit Organizations</h2>
            <p>
                Not-for-profit, non governmental organizations such as <a href="https://inspireyouths.org/"
                    target="_blank"><strong>African Youth Development Foundation</strong></a> and <strong><a
                        href="https://asanteafrica.org/" target="_blank">Asante Africa Foundation</a></strong> mobilize
                resources and promote and support sustainable youth empowerment and aim to empower the next generation
                of change agents , whose dreams and actions transform the future of Africa and the world.
            </p>
            <h2>Social Enterprises</h2>
            <p>
                These organizations seek to maximize profits while maximizing benefits to society and the environment.
                Their profits are principally used to fund social programs. The Social Enterprise movement has picked up
                momentum , and new emerging Youth led organizations are being identified as such. examples of these
                organizations include Posterity Zambia <a class="inline" href="https://posterityz.github.io/index.html"
                    target="_blank"><img src="https://posterityz.github.io/images/logo.png" alt="Posterity Zambia"></a>
            </p>
            <h3> Empact of Youth Organizations</h3>
            <p>
                The empact of the Youth organizations is being noticed in the communities, this is mainly because the
                organizations understand the needs and challenges of fellow youths better and are doing something to
                change the lives of fellow youths for the better. Many youths are now engaging in entreprenueship and
                technology.
