# CSS Basic Exercise Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the CSS Basic exercise. In this project, I have completed the following tasks and achieved the associated learning objectives:

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding of CSS and how to add styles to HTML elements.
- Knowledge of CSS classes and their usage in applying styles to multiple elements.
- Understanding of CSS selectors and how they target specific elements for styling.
- Knowledge of CSS specificity and how it affects the application of styles.
- Understanding of CSS box properties and their role in controlling the layout and dimensions of elements.
- Knowledge of how a web browser loads a webpage and applies CSS styles.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories and files:

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and its solutions.
- `css_basic/base.css`: The CSS file containing the base styles.
- `css_basic/styles.css`: The CSS file containing the project-specific styles.
- `css_basic/index.html`: The HTML file for the main webpage.
- `css_basic/tweets.html`: The HTML file for the tweets webpage.

Feel free to explore the repository to see the individual HTML and CSS files for each task.

## How to View the Webpages

To view the implemented webpages, simply open the `css_basic/index.html` and `css_basic/tweets.html` files in a web browser. Make sure to keep the CSS files (`base.css` and `styles.css`) in the same directory as the HTML files.
