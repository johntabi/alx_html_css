# HTML Basic Exercise Solution

This repository contains my solutions to the HTML Basic exercise. In this exercise, I have completed the following tasks:

1. Created a basic HTML file with a proper structure.
2. Developed a cool first webpage with paragraphs, headings, and an image.
3. Built an additional webpage with embedded tweets and links.
4. Enhanced both webpages to have a consistent structure with a header, main content, and footer.
5. Added a creative touch by incorporating a table with learner information.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `base_index.html`: The basic HTML file without any additional elements.
- `index.html`: The first webpage with paragraphs, headings, and an image.
- `tweets.html`: Another webpage with embedded tweets and links.
- Other necessary files and directories.

Feel free to explore the repository to see the implemented solutions.
